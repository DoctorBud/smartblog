I took this sampe from my backyard and I'm beginning to identify some of the things I found in it.  I should have taken a picture of where I took the sample but I forgot.  I'll go back and take a picture soon and post it here.  

The sample was a bit of moss.  I put the moss in a little bit of water and swished it around to prepare the sample and then did a wet mount with the water.  Here's a video that shows you how to make a wet mount.

#### Nemotodes

I found this little nemotode squirming about in my sample!  Isn't he cute!

There's a lot about [nemotodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode) on wikipedia.  When I have time I'll read more about them and write what I learned here.

Here's a nice drawing so you can see what all the little things inside them are.
