[Smartdown](https://smartdown.io) is a declarative, literate and reactive authoring technology for writing technical and non-technical documents that are compelling and easy to share and publish within many existing forums and blogging systems. Smartdown is designed for blogging, technical communication, and teaching. Smartdown simplifies the creation of Explorable Explanations, which are prose documents with embedded interactive content such as charts, graphs, and featherweight programs called playables.

Smartdown extends the simple expressivity of the Markdown language commonly used on blogs, messaging systems, technical forums, and on GitHub. The Smartdown engine is a Javascript library that interprets the content in these Smartdown source files and enacts the desired behavior and presentation.

You can easily add formulas to your posts.

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3=\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2
$$

You can drop in playable applications.

```p5js/playable
p5.setup = function() {
};

p5.draw = function() {
  p5.ellipse(50, 50, 80, 80);
};
```
