My name is Peter Parker.  This is a blog about the ups and downs of being a super hero. 

Here's what I look like.

### Test File for Andre's Blog

I took this sampe from my backyard and I'm beginning to identify some of the things I found in it.  I should have taken a picture of where I took the sample but I forgot.  I'll go back and take a picture soon and post it here.  

The sample was a bit of moss.  I put the moss in a little bit of water and swished it around to prepare the sample and then did a wet mount with the water.  Here's a video that shows you how to make a wet mount.
