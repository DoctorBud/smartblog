### Abstract

We're a few years into the exploding dots revolution and for many of us, James Tanton's innovative approach to math curriculum has changed the way we teach and do math.  After a few years reflection, I wanted to share some of my experiences teaching exploding dots and how it has shaped my thinking about mathematics in general.  My first take away from exploding dots is that we need to radically rethink mathematical notation and the role it plays in both math education and math research.  Historical analysis of what constitutes good mathematical notation is remarkably slim and many of the criteria are completely outdated in a digital world.  I argue that current notational systems create an uneccessary burden on learners, teachers and mathematical researchers. Reducing the cognitive load required to decipher notational symbols should be an important criteria for good mathematical notation.  I have a lot of thoughts and questions.  Too many to fit in one post, so in this post I'll focus on the lessons of exploding dots for mathematical notation.  In my next post I'll argue that these notational changes seem to lead mathematical creativity at both the education and research level.





### Intro

I first encountered James Tanton's [exploding dots](https://www.explodingdots.org/) about three years ago. I knew immediately that it was brilliant, but it has taken a few years of teaching exploding dots and reflection to clarify in my mind exactly **why** James Tanton's approach is so revolutionary. These are my thoughts and reflections as a mathematician and a teacher. Here, I argue that exploding dots is the first step in a desperately needed revision of mathematical notation.  I believe this revision in notation will allow us to change how we teach math.  Instead of teaching/telling students what math is and how to do it, we can give them a model of a system and let them invent and create the mathematics themselves.  If students are in the habit of creating mathematics as they learn, it's likely that many of them will at some point invent some mathematics that are original.

### Syntax vs. Semantics: the Task of Doing Mathematics

Discuss the model vs. the notation and how these two things interact in mathematics research and in mathematics education.

	- model
	- notation
		- communication of ideas ( How can we agree on what is said? )
		- proof of statements (include algebra in this area.  symbolic manipulation will always be part of math and will always require this cognitive skill. How can we agree on what is true? )

I argue that these are two different tasks requiring different cognitive skills, but that the model skills are primary.  There may be two different notational systems for reasoning, with different properties.  If they are both correct, the mathematical results will be the same.

The syntax is just a tool.  The model is the real thing.


Let's break down the **doing** of mathematics into two parts.  The first part is to understand the [model](::model/tooltip).  The model may be a phyisical model like the *base machine* from exploding dots.  It's something we can build, see and manipulate.  Models can also be abstract.  For example, we might imagine a machine that counts.  Then we imagine the machine counting forever and never stopping.  Then we call the result of that machine's process infinity.  We can't build this machine and we might have some doubt about whether the result of a process that never ends is a meaningful idea, but the imagining of this machine provides a model for the concept of infinity.  The model is where the math lives.  It is where we see and where we understand.

[An aside on models](::modelaside)
# :::: modelaside
I'm side stepping some important issues around mathematical models.  Many mathematical topics may have more than one model. Some models may be better than others. There are also areas of mathematics that don't have a model rooted in the physical world.  However, mathematical questions that can't be phrased in terms of a physical process we can imagine are likely to be [formally independent](::formally_independent/tooltip).  Fortunately, you aren't likely to run into these types of questions in a K-12 math classroom.

# :::: model
Here I mean **model** in the usual sense.   In first order logic the term model has a more specific definition.
# ::::


# :::: formally_independent
A mathematical statement is [formally independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(mathematical_logic)) if the truth of that statement cannot be proven or disproven within the standard axiom systems, such as Zermelo- Fraenkel set theory.  The [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis) and the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice) are examples of statements that are formally independent.
# ::::


The second part to the **doing** of mathematics is communicating about the model.  We need to write and read statements about the model.  We use these statements to share ideas about the model and to prove that they are true or false.  This is where notation enters the picture.  Notation is the set of symbols and arrangement of symbols we use to write statements about the model.  We use it to pose questions and to write answers.

Applying rules to sentences to produce new sentences. Symbolic reasoning.


### Historical Review of Mathematical Notation

For me, one of the main take aways of exploding dots and many other areas of James Tanton's innovative math curriculum is that we need to radically rethink mathematical notation and the role notation plays in both math education and math research.

When I began work on this blog post, I did some research to see what has been said and written about what constitutes good mathematical notation.  I found that remarkably little has been written about this topic.  There doesn't seem to be any formal study of mathematic notation and how math research and math education is non existant.  What does exist doesn't question notation that is basically archaic.

We could start from the ground up and reimagine mathematical notation.  Let's ignore for the moment the unanswered question of whether this is a good idea.  What's interesting to me is that no one seems to have considered this at all as an option.  

For me, one of the main lessons from James Tanton's exploding dots is the the mathematical notation we use plays enormous role .

There are a lot of questions, all without answers.  So this post I will be limited to sharing anecdotal evidence and posing questions and hypotheses.

this is exactly what is necessary.  In many areas of mathematics, it's time to start over with an entirely new approach to mathematical notation.

Literature recognizes that there may be more than one notation for something and we should choose the best one, (criteria?).  Mathematicians will make up new notation for new math.  Lacking: full understanding of role of notaion and rebuild notations that are more optimal.  We don't have to pick from established notations, we could begin again.  

I propose that the main problem with current notation is cognitive load.  We are no longer constrained by earlier criteria needed for pen and paper, typography.  Computers show most notations.


- there is remarkably little written about mathematical notation.  Few people have put forth requirements and there's no system to encourage the requirements are met. 
- why do we have the notations that we do?  Because they are the best? The process of keeping and discarding notations over time is not impressive. In the end, Cajori criticized sharply that as a community, mathemati- cians do not have any effective cooperative mechanism that could smooth out the many conflicts and confusions in mathematical notations. 


Mathematical notation is also archaic.  The notations we teach and use today were all developed ages ago during a time when all math was written painstakingly with pen and paper.  Our notations follow no standards or protocols.  It's a free for all of weird unintuitive symbols that evolved over time with each mathemetician adding on where others left off with no hope of a coherent strategy. 

It's true that mathematicians tend to be very good at deciphering symbols.  They are so good at it that they don't really notice that they are doing it.  It's tempting to say that this is an important prerequisite for a career in mathematics.  But perhaps, if we had better notational systems we'd have an entirely different set of mathematicians.  Mathematicians wouldn't need such strong symbol reading skills and would have a skill set focosed on imagining, interpreting and proving things about models.  Which world do you want to do math in?


### Requirements for notation

Discuss historical requirements.  ( Not enforced though they may be. )

- precise ( for well formed unambiguous statements )
- efficient
- language independent
- Good notations should be extendable when new ideas emerge. 
- Good notations should be typographically easy to produce.
- easy to understand 


### Lessons from Exploding Dots

- efficient. (outdated)
- precise  ( how formal? depends on context )
- easy to understand (What does this mean?  Should be changed to low cognitive load for translation. )

- efficiency is outmoded requirement
- typographic restrictions are outmoded.
- the most important requirement should be reducing cognitive load.
	- this will fuel mathematical creativity

	1. notations doesn't suggest correct model.
	2. the notation causes high cognitive load in interpretation.

	- example from algebra.  letters to represent variables.  Wouldn't it be better to have a box.  The idea of a hidden or mystery element.  We know things about it and can infer more removing the mystery.  Our notation says none of this.  

### Cognitive Load

1. My personal experience leads me to this model
2. Math is aware of this Syntax vs. Semantics
3. My teaching experience suggests this model
4. is there research on cognitive tasks of notation in lit?
5. what can we gleen from more general research on information processing?

Most mathematical notation is a pain in the ass.  When we do math, we are constantly translating back and forth between the model and the notation.  We read a problem written with some symbols, we figure out what that means in terms of the model.  We figure out how to solve the problem by thinking about the model and then we translate our answer back into symbols so others can read it.  The constant translation creates an enormous cognitive load on the brain.  This brain suck doesn't have to do with the actual math, it's just about interpreting symbols.  A challenging problem will often require repeated translations between model and notation.  It's like a tiresome game of telephone where small details get lost or mutated. Digits are transposed, decimals are dropped. The additional strain of the translating is a constant distraction, errors are made and meaning gets lost.  

It seems reasonable to assume that a large part of doing mathematics is processing symbols into meaning about the model.  There is substantial cognitive load that comes from this.  Can we improve notations to reduce this load on the brain, freeing it up to concentrate on the model itself.

In my time in the classroom, I've often had students who were sad and frustrated and felt they were no good at math.  Upon further investigation, I often discover that they understand the model perfectly.  They were struggling to decipher the symbols and do the translation.  Many of these students spend their life thinking they are no good at math, but that's not an accurate description of the situation.  It's more often that they struggle with deciphering symbols.  This always makes me sad.


Enter James Tanton and exploding dots.  The brilliance of exploding dots is that the model and the notation have merged.  He abandons standard notation for number theory and just a draws a picture of a physical model (also, it's a very good model).  There's no strain from  deciphering crazy symbols.  There's no translation errors.  What's left is pure mathematical exploration and understanding.  We all know the dopamine release you get when you have a mathematical insight or see the answer to a challenging problem.  Exploding dots makes these joyful moments more concentrated.  

It's hard to argue with the result.  If you've witnessed, as I have 4th and 5th graders master the kind of number theory basics usually reserved for undergraduate math majors there's really no going back.  It's clear that we've been making math so much harder than it needs to be.

Now it's true there is a point when working large complicated problems that drawing all the dots and boxes can get tedious and we sometimes revert back to our old base ten representation.  There may still be a need for consise pen and paper notations sometimes.  However, going forward into the digital age, this need will become less and less as more of our mathematical communication becomes digital.  I say this as someone who prefers to teach exploding dots with a handful of rocks and sidewalk chalk on a sunny day to the online exploding dots experience, fabulous as it is.  

It makes you wonder, what other areas of mathematics could benefit from the same kind of notational restart?  How do we recreate the exploding dots success?  I think it's  time to revise all of our mathematical notation.  We need to start from scratch, work with a good model and build new notations that are closer visually to the model.  Computers can help by allowing us to work with notations that we would never attempt if we had to write them with pen and paper.

I'm not advocating abandoning all mathematical notation.  There will always be a role for ..... computers will use bizarre notations.  Pen and paper will limit.  

### Rethinking Symbolic Reasoning: A Layered Approach 


- at the heart of mathematical notation will always be strings.  The role that strings play in math is essential. Formal proof systems determine mathematical proof.  Formal proof systems are mechanical manipulation of symbols. This marry's the field of mathematics and computer science.  This will always require symbolic manipulation.  Strings.  Computers.  This creates a layering of notations. Human notations are different than computer notations.
	- Semantics / model
	- human readable logic statements about the model. F.O.L.
	- statements for input to a deductions system.  SAT
	- unicode
	- binary strings
	- registers with varying current.

- IDEA: the layered approach to notation.  With computers we can create notation that can be layered.  A picture that shows the model that can reveal a logic string and under that a 0-1 string.
- Make the learning process aware of the translation process between syntax and semantics.  A high level notation where you could look under the hood so to speak.








- some notations hold back progress.  exploding dots enhances mathematical creativity.
