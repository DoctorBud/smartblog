I first encountered James Tanton's [exploding dots](https://www.explodingdots.org/) about three years ago. I knew immediately that it was brilliant, but it has taken a few years of teaching exploding dots and reflection to clarify in my mind exactly **why** James Tanton's approach is so revolutionary. These are my thoughts and reflections as a mathematician and a teacher. Here, I argue that exploding dots is the first step in a desperately needed revision of mathematical notation.  I believe this revision in notation will allow us to change how we teach math.  Instead of teaching/telling students what math is and how to do it, we can give them a model of a system and let them invent and create the mathematics themselves.  If students are in the habit of creating mathematics as they learn, it's likely that many of them will at some point invent some mathematics that are original.


#### Semantics

I like to break down the **doing** of mathematics into two parts.  The first part is to understand the [model](::model/tooltip).  The model may be a phyisical model like the *base machine* from exploding dots.  It's something we can build, see and manipulate.  Models can also be abstract.  For example, we might imagine a machine that counts.  Then we imagine the machine counting forever and never stopping.  Then we call the result of that machine's process infinity.  We can't build this machine and we might have some doubt about whether the result of a process that never ends is a meaningful idea, but the imagining of this machine provides a model for the concept of infinity.  The model is where the math lives.  It is where we see and where we understand.

[An aside on models](::modelaside)
# :::: modelaside
I'm side stepping some important issues around mathematical models.  Many mathematical topics may have more than one model. Some models may be better than others. There are also areas of mathematics that don't have a model rooted in the physical world.  However, mathematical questions that can't be phrased in terms of a physical process we can imagine are likely to be [formally independent](::formally_independent/tooltip).  Fortunately, you aren't likely to run into these types of questions in a K-12 math classroom.

# :::: model
Here I mean **model** in the usual sense.   In first order logic the term model has a more specific definition.
# ::::


# :::: formally_independent
A mathematical statement is [formally independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(mathematical_logic)) if the truth of that statement cannot be proven or disproven within the standard axiom systems, such as Zermelo- Fraenkel set theory.  The [continuum hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis) and the [axiom of choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice) are examples of statements that are formally independent.
# ::::


The second part to the **doing** of mathematics is communicating about the model.  We need to write and read statements about the model.  We use these statements to share ideas about the model and to prove that they are true or false.  This is where notation enters the picture.  Notation is the set of symbols and arrangement of symbols we use to write statements about the model.  We use it to pose questions and to write answers.

#### Syntax

Most mathematical notation is a pain in the ass.  When we do math, we are constantly translating back and forth between the model and the notation.  We read a problem written with some symbols, we figure out what that means in terms of the model.  We figure out how to solve the problem by thinking about the model and then we translate our answer back into symbols so others can read it.  The constant translation creates an enormous cognitive load on the brain.  This brain suck doesn't have to do with the actual math, it's just about interpreting symbols.  A challenging problem will often require repeated translations between model and notation.  It's like a tiresome game of telephone where small details get lost or mutated. Digits are transposed, decimals are dropped. The additional strain of the translating is a constant distraction, errors are made and meaning gets lost.   

[Is there research on this?](::research)
# :::: research
I would expect that someone has done research on this in the mathematics education or cognitive science fields.  I'd love to have some references if anyone can point me in the right direction.
# ::::

Mathematical notation is also archaic.  The notations we teach and use today were all developed ages ago during a time when all math was written painstakingly with pen and paper.  Our notations follow no standards or protocols.  It's a free for all of weird unintuitive symbols that evolved over time with each mathemetician adding on where others left off with no hope of a coherent strategy. 

It's true that mathematicians tend to be very good at deciphering symbols.  They are so good at it that they don't really notice that they are doing it.  It's tempting to say that this is an important prerequisite for a career in mathematics.  But perhaps, if we had better notational systems we'd have an entirely different set of mathematicians.  Mathematicians wouldn't need such strong symbol reading skills and would have a skill set focosed on imagining, interpreting and proving things about models.  Which world do you want to do math in?

In my time in the classroom, I've often had students who were sad and frustrated and felt they were no good at math.  Upon further investigation, I often discover that they understand the model perfectly.  They were struggling to decipher the symbols and do the translation.  Many of these students spend their life thinking they are no good at math, but that's not an accurate description of the situation.  It's more often that they struggle with deciphering symbols.  This always makes me sad.


#### The Exploding Dots Model

Enter James Tanton and exploding dots.  The brilliance of exploding dots is that the model and the notation have merged.  He abandons standard notation for number theory and just a draws a picture of a physical model (also, it's a very good model).  There's no strain from  deciphering crazy symbols.  There's no translation errors.  What's left is pure mathematical exploration and understanding.  We all know the dopamine release you get when you have a mathematical insight or see the answer to a challenging problem.  Exploding dots makes these joyful moments more concentrated.  

It's hard to argue with the result.  If you've witnessed, as I have 4th and 5th graders master the kind of number theory basics usually reserved for undergraduate math majors there's really no going back.  It's clear that we've been making math so much harder than it needs to be.

Now it's true there is a point when working large complicated problems that drawing all the dots and boxes can get tedious and we sometimes revert back to our old base ten representation.  There may still be a need for consise pen and paper notations sometimes.  However, going forward into the digital age, this need will become less and less as more of our mathematical communication becomes digital.  I say this as someone who prefers to teach exploding dots with a handful of rocks and sidewalk chalk on a sunny day to the online exploding dots experience, fabulous as it is.  

It makes you wonder, what other areas of mathematics could benefit from the same kind of notational restart?  How do we recreate the exploding dots success?  I think it's  time to revise all of our mathematical notation.  We need to start from scratch, work with a good model and build new notations that are closer visually to the model.  Computers can help by allowing us to work with notations that we would never attempt if we had to write them with pen and paper.

#### Nurturing Mathematical Creativity

Here's a true story from my experiences teaching exploding dots.  I was working with a fairly advanced exploding dots student who was around 12 at the time.  He knew how to add, subtract and divide in binary.  At this point Dr. Tanton hadn't added multiplication to the curriculum.  So I asked this student somewhat rhetorically how he might multiply in a base two machine.  He thought about it briefly and then gave me a beautiful simple method.  Once I could see that it was correct I thought of the obvious next question any researcher would ask.  Does this generalize to any base?  So I asked him that question and he said yes and he showed me how to do it.  It took about 20-30 minutes in total.  


This student was definitely an unusual and precocious kid, but I can assure you, we would have never have had that conversation without exploding dots.   This story is the most dramatic of my experiences but it isn't atypical.  All the students I taught exploding dots seemed to experience an increased level of mathematical creativity. I'd love to see a scientific study on this although I'm not sure what the methodology would be.   When students can focus on the model, things start to happen.  They start to see and understand on a deeper level.  What follows is the ability to create.  It happens naturally, especially with kids.  They create their own algorithms.  They find that there isn't one right way to do it.  They evaluate their own methods and decide whether their creations are correct.  

Unfortunately, we won't see this if we don't change the way we teach.  I could have very easily missed the interaction with the boy in my story because I didn't really ask my first question with the expectation that he would answer it.  It made me wonder how many of these moments I'd missed with students because I was stuck teaching traditionally, telling students how to do it instead of letting them invent it.  I'm constantly struggling with this as a teacher and as an aspiring writer of educational materials.  I help way too much.  I tell and show too much rather than laying down the pieces and patiently waiting, allowing students to struggle and find their own way.  


Although I don't fully know how to teach and write this way, the value of this approach is enormous. Imagine a curriculum where instead of learning to add subtract and multiply, students invented these methods.  I don't fully know what that would look like but I want to say something about what it won't look like.  The creativity and inventing I saw in the exploding dots classroom looked a lot like what you see in the real world.  It wasn't a lone genius alone in room who makes a great discovery. Progress happened incrementally with small steps made in groups moving the discovery forward.  Not every child needs to reinvent mathematics alone from the ground up, they just need to witness and participate in the process. Now imagine students doing this in all their studies. They spend their earlier years exploring and reinventing known results.   Think what happens when children trained this way reach the frontiers of math, science and knowledge?   Exploding dots has pointed the way. There are so many unanswered questions and I don't know the way forward.  But we've seen enough to know that it is possible. It's up to us to figure it out.
