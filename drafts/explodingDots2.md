#### Nurturing Mathematical Creativity

My experience is that Exp Dots students experience a remarkable increase in mathematical creativity.  What did other teachers experience?  Can we measure this?  If it's true then why?

Here's a true story from my experiences teaching exploding dots.  I was working with a fairly advanced exploding dots student who was around 12 at the time.  He knew how to add, subtract and divide in binary.  At this point Dr. Tanton hadn't added multiplication to the curriculum.  So I asked this student somewhat rhetorically how he might multiply in a base two machine.  He thought about it briefly and then gave me a beautiful simple method.  Once I could see that it was correct I thought of the obvious next question any researcher would ask.  Does this generalize to any base?  So I asked him that question and he said yes and he showed me how to do it.  It took about 20-30 minutes in total.  


This student was definitely an unusual and precocious kid, but I can assure you, we would have never have had that conversation without exploding dots.   This story is the most dramatic of my experiences but it isn't atypical.  All the students I taught exploding dots seemed to experience an increased level of mathematical creativity. I'd love to see a scientific study on this although I'm not sure what the methodology would be.   When students can focus on the model, things start to happen.  They start to see and understand on a deeper level.  What follows is the ability to create.  It happens naturally, especially with kids.  They create their own algorithms.  They find that there isn't one right way to do it.  They evaluate their own methods and decide whether their creations are correct.  

Unfortunately, we won't see this if we don't change the way we teach.  I could have very easily missed the interaction with the boy in my story because I didn't really ask my first question with the expectation that he would answer it.  It made me wonder how many of these moments I'd missed with students because I was stuck teaching traditionally, telling students how to do it instead of letting them invent it.  I'm constantly struggling with this as a teacher and as an aspiring writer of educational materials.  I help way too much.  I tell and show too much rather than laying down the pieces and patiently waiting, allowing students to struggle and find their own way.  


Although I don't fully know how to teach and write this way, the value of this approach is enormous. Imagine a curriculum where instead of learning to add subtract and multiply, students invented these methods.  I don't fully know what that would look like but I want to say something about what it won't look like.  The creativity and inventing I saw in the exploding dots classroom looked a lot like what you see in the real world.  It wasn't a lone genius alone in room who makes a great discovery. Progress happened incrementally with small steps made in groups moving the discovery forward.  Not every child needs to reinvent mathematics alone from the ground up, they just need to witness and participate in the process. Now imagine students doing this in all their studies. They spend their earlier years exploring and reinventing known results.   Think what happens when children trained this way reach the frontiers of math, science and knowledge?   Exploding dots has pointed the way. There are so many unanswered questions and I don't know the way forward.  But we've seen enough to know that it is possible. It's up to us to figure it out.
